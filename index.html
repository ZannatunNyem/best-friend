            <H2>She is always surrounded by negative energy</H2>
            <p>She is worried about her silly things.But in most cases she thinks more about unnecessary things.she
                prefers to let everyone know and worry unnecessarily than to find a solution to a problem.This is why
                she needs a proton to keep herself positive all the time.</p>
